                A. bainii had a beak as well as palatal ridges which lends evidence to it being a 
                herbivore.  They most likely ate from the Schizoneura and Phyllotheca genuses, as those were the most 
                common plants in it's environment.  The beak helped it cut through the stems of the woody plants.
