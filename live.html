                    A. bainii first appeared in the Cistecephalus Assemblage Zone.  This is in present day South Africa.
                    This biozone is named after Cistecephalus, a small dicynodont. Since so many Aulacephalodon fossils were found 
                    in this area, it was proposed to change the name to the Aulacephalodon Assemblage Zone. So, for a brief while 
                    there was a compromise and the zone was called the Aulacephalodon-Cistecephalus Zone.  And, seemingly like all 
                    compromises, that naming came to and end in favor of the original name, since the Cistecephalus was the first
                    fossils found there.

                    The overall climate of this area was not suitable for diversity.  Aulacephalodon occupied about 
                    86% of this area.
