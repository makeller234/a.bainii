                        Aulacephalodon bainii.  Live about 299-252 million years ago, during the Permian period.
                        Aulacephalodon are a part of the dicynodontia taxon.  Dicynodonts are characterized by having 2 tusks.

                       What mostly attracted me to want to learn more about A. bainii was most definitely because it's cute.  I knew that I would 
                       have to look at a lot of images of it as I did research and I didn't want to pick something that wasn't pleasing
                       to the eye. Okay, it's not the main reason I chose it.  I remembered that only 30% of terrestrial species survived the 
                       Permian extinction, and A. bainii was one of those species, so I was curious to learn more about those species, and that led me
                       to finding the A. bainii.

                            <p class="card-text">It comes from a triad of Greek words.  Aulak meaning "a furrow", kephale meaning "head" 
                                and odon meaning "tooth". So the name furrow-head-tooth was born, well maybe not born, but strung together in a logical fashion.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">A. bainii had a beak as well as palatal ridges which lends evidence to it being a 
                                herbivore.  They most likely ate from the Schizoneura and Phyllotheca genuses, as those were the most 
                                common plants in it's environment.  The beak helped it cut through the stems of the woody plants.
