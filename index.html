                        Aulacephalodon bainii.  Live about 299-252 million years ago, during the Permian period.
                        Aulacephalodon are a part of the dicynodontia taxon.  Dicynodonts are characterized by having 2 tusks.

                       What mostly attracted me to want to learn more about A. bainii was most definitely because it's cute.  I knew that I would 
                       have to look at a lot of images of it as I did research and I didn't want to pick something that wasn't pleasing
                       to the eye. Okay, it's not the main reason I chose it.  I remembered that only 30% of terrestrial species survived the 
                       Permian extinction, and A. bainii was one of those species, so I was curious to learn more about those species, and that led me
                       to finding the A. bainii.

                            <p class="card-text">It comes from a triad of Greek words.  Aulak meaning "a furrow", kephale meaning "head" 
                                and odon meaning "tooth". So the name furrow-head-tooth was born, well maybe not born, but strung together in a logical fashion.</p>

                                    <li>Their unique feature is that they had tusks instead of canines, and are the only dicynodonts 
                                    with tusks.  This makes up for the fact that they’re just medium-sized compared to other dicynodonts. A.bainii 
                                    are known for having short, broad skulls.  3 of the main criteria used to determine if a skull belongs to A. 
                                    bainii are the length-breadth ratio, the shape of cranial bones, and nasal bosses.

                                    <li>They may have been inefficient walkers.  Footprints were found, and while not sure if they actually belong
                                     to A.bainii or a related species, the pace of these footprints is about 600mm and the overall tracks 
                                     had a width of 800mm.

                                    <li>They also have a beak structure at the end of their short snout and palatal ridges which shows that 
                                    biting took place at the tip of their jaws.

                                herbivore.  They most likely ate from the Schizoneura and Phyllotheca genuses, as those were the most 
                                common plants in it's environment.  The beak helped it cut through the stems of the woody plants.
