                        I don't know. Apparently, when you google "How did Aulacephalodon survive the Permian Extinction" 
                        you don't get an answer from Google like when you search life's other great mysteries like "In scent, 
                        which is silent the s or the c." Since Google wasn't going to give me an easy time with this one,
                        it was time to use some critical thinking.
                    <p>
                        First thought: Food. Animals can't survive without food, so maybe the type of food A. bainii ate 
                        survived the extinction as well. <a href="https://www.livescience.com/43295-triassic-period.html#:~:text=In%20higher%20latitudes%2C%20gymnosperms%20survived,the%20newer%20groups%20of%20beetles.">
                        This source</a> says that in the upper latitudes gymnosperms and conifer forests survived and that ferns survived in coastal regions.
                        Unfortunately, A. bainii didn't live in theses areas. 
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permian%E2%80%93Triassic_extinction_event#Terrestrial_plants"> This source</a> 
                        says that plants are relatively immune to mass extinction, but plant abundances and distributions can change. 

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Second Thought: Maybe it has to do with the type of animal it is? Aulacephalodon are Synapsids, or proto-mammals, and A.bainii is medium-sized compared 
                        to other dicynodonts. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permian%E2%80%93Triassic_extinction_event#Terrestrial_vertebrates">Large herbivores</a>
                         suffered the biggest losses. Which makes sense, as the plant abundance and distributions are changing, 
                        large herbivores need more food, so it would have been a lot harder for them to find adequate food. So A. bainii 
                        would have had a better chance at survival being medium-sized.
