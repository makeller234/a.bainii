                        <li>Their unique feature is that they had tusks instead of canines, and are the only dicynodonts 
                        with tusks.  This makes up for the fact that theyâ€™re just medium-sized compared to other dicynodonts. A.bainii 
                        are known for having short, broad skulls.  3 of the main criteria used to determine if a skull belongs to A. 
                        bainii are the length-breadth ratio, the shape of cranial bones, and nasal bosses.

                        <li>They may have been inefficient walkers.  Footprints were found, and while not sure if they actually belong
                        to A.bainii or a related species, the pace of these footprints is about 600mm and the overall tracks 
                        had a width of 800mm.

                        <li>They also have a beak structure at the end of their short snout and palatal ridges which shows that 
                        biting took place at the tip of their jaws.
