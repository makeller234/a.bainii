                    Dominate terrestrial vertebrate of its time. It’s speculated that because of 
                    A.bainii’s ontogenetically increasing body size, the size of its occupied niche increased as well. 
                    This thought is based on Alligator and Crocodylus who have ecological roles that change throughout 
                    their life.
